With the GitHub flow, you only ever have 2 branches:
  - main (or master) - similar to GitFlow the main branch contains all the deployable code for the project.
  - feature - developers branch directly off of main to work on new features.

For GitHub flow, the general process is as follows:
  - As with Git Flow, an empty main branch is created at the start of a new project.
  - Every change that is worked on is branched directly off of main into a feature branch.
  - Once a feature is ready it is tested on the feature branch and the code is reviewed before being merged to main.
  - Once the feature has been merged to main it should be released to production immediately.
